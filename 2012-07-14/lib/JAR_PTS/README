	   Some Type Theory and Lambda Calculus Formalized

		   James McKinna and Randy Pollack

This directory contains the LEGO source files (".l" files) of a formal
development described in a paper to appear in the Journal of Formal
Reasoning.  It has all been checked by LEGO Version 1.3.1, the
official release version at time of writing.  

LEGO, its documentation, and examples are available from the LEGO WWW
homepage <http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/lego/>.  To use these files,
you probably must have some familiarity with LEGO.

This development is over 2 man-years of work by James McKinna and
Randy Pollack.  In has many parallel and some mutually exclusive
branches.

You can load "filename.l" by typing "Make filename" to the LEGO
toplevel prompt.  This will Make all that filename depends on, as well
as filename.  As LEGO loads .l files, it will "compile" the proofs
they contain into lambda terms, writing out corresponding ".o" files.
Thes .o files will Make much faster than the original .l files.

BUG: one file, "conversion_cut.l" calls a tactic (Cut) that changes
the context of previously inhabited types; thus "conversion_cut.l"
cannot really be compiled.  If you have difficulty loading a file
called conversion_cut, just delete "conversion_cut.o" (which will
force LEGO to use the uncompiled conversion_cut.l) and try again.
