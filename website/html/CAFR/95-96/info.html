<P>
The course meets Tuesdays at 10:00 in room 3317  and Thursdays 
at 3:00 in room 3317, through 12 December.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00002000000000000000> Tutorials</A></H2>
<P>
The first tutorials will be at 10:00am and 4:00pm on Friday, 13 October
in or near room 2501.  The scheduled lecture times during the week of
16 October will be informal tutorials starting in room 3317.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION00003000000000000000> Syllabus</A></H2>
<P>
The course covers foundations for and applications of computer
aided formal reasoning.  A rough outline is:
<OL><LI> Motivation 
<LI> Reasoning about programs
<LI> Deriving programs using proofs
<LI> Propositional logic
<LI> Predicate logic
<LI> Representing mathematical objects
</OL>
There will be several marked practicals using the LEGO proof assistant.

<P>
There is no  required text for this course.  You may find the
books below useful as references or for further reading.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00004100000000000000> Background</A></H3>
<P>
For background reading on proof,
D. J. Velleman's <em> How to Prove it: a Structured Approach</em> (1994)
is recommended.
<P>
For background mathematics, see J. K. Truss, <em> Discrete 
Mathematics for Computer Scientists</em>.  This book appears
to be on reserve in the JCMB library.  Chapters 1,2, 5, and 6
are particularly relevant.
<P>
Larry Paulson's <em> ML for the Working Programmer</em> is an introduction
to functional programming using ML.

<P>
<em> Type Theory and Functional Programming</em>, by Simon Thompson,
is a useful reference as well as an introductory text.  It is
 worth buying if you are interested in
the mathematical ideas discussed in the course.
<P>
<em> Computation and Reasoning: a type theory for computer 
science</em>, by Z. Luo, is a deeper study of the theory
underlying LEGO.
<P>
<em> Proof and Types</em>, by Girard, Lafont, and Taylor, gives
detailed theoretical foundations for some of these topics.
<P>
Other related books include:
<P>
<em> The Automation of Proof: An Historical and Sociological Exploration</em>,
by Donald MacKenzie.
<P>
<em> The Computer Modelling of Mathematical Reasoning</em>, by Alan Bundy.
