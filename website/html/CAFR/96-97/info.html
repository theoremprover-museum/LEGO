<P>
The course meets Tuesdays at noon in room 3218 and
Thursdays at 2:00pm in room 3317, through 6 December.
<P>
We will be using the Lego proof assistant extensively
during the course.  To help you get started  with the system,
I plan to arrange a few lab/tutorial sessions during
the first half of the course.  These will probably be 
in the lab in room 2501.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">What</A></H1>
<P>
A rough outline of the course is:
<UL><LI> Propositional logic<LI> Lambda calculus<LI> Proof by induction<LI> Propositions and types<LI> Quantification<LI> Representing mathematical objects<LI> Formal program development
</UL>
<P>
There is some flexibility in the later part of the term,
and once the foundation has been laid I will offer the
class a number of topics to choose from.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00031100000000000000">Background material</A></H3>
<P>
A couple of books on proof, useful if you do not have much 
experience with mathematical proofs in practice are:
<P>
Kelleman, D.J. (1994) <I>How to Prove it: a Structured Approach. </I>
(&#163;14.95)
and
<P>
Exner, George R. (1996)  <I>An Accompaniment to Higher Mathematics.</I>
(&#163;22.50)  This book is designed for undergraduate mathematics
students, but contains a good deal of practical logic as well, and
is written in a very friendly style.
<P>
For background mathematics which you might need to catch up on, the
following book covers the material needed without too much elaboration.
<P>
Truss, J.K. (1991) <I>Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists, </I>
Addison Wesley (&#163;19.95).  See especially chapters 1, 2, 5 and 6.
<P>
For background in functional programming, using ML, see Paulson (1991)
<I>ML for the Working Programmer</I>.
<P>
For background in lambda-calculus, see  Gunter (1992), <I>Semantics
of Programming Languages</I>, sections 2.1 and 2.2.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00031200000000000000">Main books relevant to the course</A></H3>
<P>
There is no set text for the course.  Lecture notes will be distributed,
which will cover all examinable material.
The books below give more details on the topics covered.
The most suitable for M.Sc. students are probably Thompson and 
chapters 7 and 8 of Luo.  Ph.D. students may be interested 
in <I>Proofs and Types</I>.
<P>
Thompson, S. (1991) <I>Type Theory and Functional Programming</I>, Addison
Wesley (about &#163;24.95).
<P>
Luo, Z. 1994 <I>Computation and Reasoning: a type theory for computer
science.</I> Clarendon Press, Oxford (&#163;30.00).
<P>
Girard, Lafont and Taylor. <I>Proofs and Types.</I>  Cambridge (about 
&#163;18).

Martin-Lof Type Theory:  an introduction.</I>  Clarendon Press, Oxford.
