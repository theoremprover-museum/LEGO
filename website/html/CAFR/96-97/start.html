<H1> Getting started with Lego </H1>
 <P>
The first step in getting started with Lego is to 
set an environment variable specifying which version
is desired.
There are several versions of Lego available; some are 
essentially alpha test versions of new extensions, so are
not the best for beginners.  The version we want is
called "cafr", so you should put the following line
in your .benv file in your home directory:
 <P>
<KBD>export LEGOVERSION=cafr</KBD>
 <P>
(You may have to create the file .benv; this file is 
executed every time a shell starts in a new environment.)
 <P>
This choice will not take effect unless you now 
logout and login again; however, for today the
default version will be fine.
 <P>
Create a directory called lego in your home directory.
Copy the file <A HREF="example.l">example.l</A> into your lego
directory.  (The full path for this file on CS machines
<KBD>/home/lego/pub/html/CAFR/96-97/example.l</KBD>.)
Now edit this file with xemacs.
 <P>
Xemacs  will automatically load a special mode for Lego files
if the file extension is ".l".  
The first line of the example file creates a module
called "example", and specifies that it imports another
module called "lib_logic".  All commands are terminated by
a semicolon.
 <P>
If you press the third mouse button, you will get a popup
menu of Lego commands.  Choose "Start LEGO".  
 <P>
Lego will start in another buffer.  The two buffers
communicate, so that you can type commands in your own file
and send them to the Lego process.  You can do this
via the menu, or directly with some shortcuts.  Of course, 
you can type directly to lego
as well if you wish, but your commands will not
be saved in a file.
 <P>
First, process the whole buffer, either by selecting
this option from the menu or by typing ^c^b (that's 
control-c, control-b).  This will load in the requested
libraries and process all of the commands.
 <P>
The lecture notes contain an explanation of what each
step does in this example proof.  To run through the first 
proof step-by-step, you can process each line in 
turn with ^c^j. Notice that this moves you automatically
to the next line in the file.  
 <P>
If you try to process the second proof in the file
in the same way, Lego will complain because it already
has a proof called "example", which it saved the first
time it went through the file.  You can modify the
name and step through this proof as well.
 <P>
When you are typing your own proofs, it is nice to 
have Lego process your commands automatically, as
you go along.  To do this, you can choose "toggle
active ;" from the menu (alternatively, type ^c ;).
This will send each command to Lego as soon as you
type the concluding semicolon.
 <P>
Now you are ready to try your own proofs!
