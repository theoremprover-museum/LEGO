<H1>Topics in Type Theory</h1>

<hr>

This course is being held in room 5327, JCMB at 4 pm, Mondays and
Wednesdays starting Monday 12th February 1996.  It is arranged for the
theory PG students, although others are of course welcome.

The course aims to give an introduction to two central topics in the
(syntactic) meta-theory of various type systems. In the first part of
the course (Lectures 1-5; <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/generated/infopages/jhm.html">James McKinna</a>), we focus on Barendregt's
lambda-cube, and its generalisations known as Pure Type Systems, in
order to study the problem of type-synthesis and type-checking; in the
second (Lectures 6-9; <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/generated/infopages/hhg.html">Healf Goguen</a>), we study proofs of strong
normalisation using the technique of typed operational semantics, and
discuss extensions of the basic functional framework of Part One to
embrace inductive types and families of inductive types.

There is a
<a href="./biblio.dvi.gz">bibliography</a>
for the course, and
there are lecture notes for the lectures on
<a href="./tos.dvi.gz">typed operational semantics</a> and
<a href="./F.dvi.gz">normalization for System F</a>.
Exercises will be given
throughout, and the exam question will probably be a straight choice
between a substantial exercise based on Part One or on Part Two.

	predicates. Statement of Church-Rosser (CR),
	Subject Reduction (SR) and Strong Normalisation (SN) theorems. 

<li>
Lecture 3, 19 February: <br>
	Pure Type Systems (PTS) as a generalisation of PCC and the

	"Girard-style" and "Martin-L&ouml;f-style" proofs. Differences
	between proofs for Church- and Curry-style typing.
	"Kripke-style".
