<HR>      <h1>LEGO Version 1.3.1: Conditional Visibility</h1>

Pi- and lambda-bindings in LEGO are marked with a visibility, indicating
whether, in the corresponding applications, the relevant arguments are
syntactically
<UL>
<LI> <B>explicit</B>, indicated by `:', as in <TT>nil:{A:Type}list A</TT>, or
<LI> <B>implicit</B>, indicated by `|', as in
     <TT>cons:{A|Type}A->(list A)->list A</TT>
</UL>

The intention is that earlier arguments which can be inferred from the
types of later arguments may safely be suppressed.
<P>

A parameter, when discharged, carries its original visibility with it into
each place it is bound. This meant that in definitions such as
<TT>list</TT>, either the element type was always implicit and <TT>nil</TT>
was awkward, or it was always explicit and <TT>cons</TT> was awkward. The
unsatisfactory workaround was to make it explicit, rename the <TT>cons</TT>
constructor, then define <TT>cons</TT> as a lambda term with the correct
visibility. Some appearances of the renamed constructor were inevitable.
<P>

Hence <B>conditional</B> visibility, indicated by `?'. When a
conditionally visible variable is bound, its visibility is made
implicit if it occurs in a subsequent pi-bound argument of its range
type, and explicit otherwise.  Consequently, <TT>[A?Prop][a?A]a</TT>
is translated as <TT>[A|Prop][a:A]a</TT>, since in its type
<TT>{A|Prop}A->A</TT>, the <TT>A</TT> occurs in the argument type
immediately left of the <TT>-></TT>.
<P>

The same holds for discharging, so that<BR>
<PRE>
Inductive [list:SET]
Parameters [A?SET]
Constructors
  [nil:list]
  [cons:A->list->list];
Discharge A;
</PRE>
leaves <TT>A</TT> explicit for <TT>list</TT> and <TT>nil</TT>, but implicit
for <TT>cons</TT> and <TT>list_elim</TT>.
<P>

The library definitions of <tt>list</tt> and <tt>vector</tt> have been
updated to use this new feature. This afftects the visibility of the
type parameter for <tt>list_elim</tt>, <tt>vcons</tt>, <tt>vect_elim</tt>
and so forth, hence some proof scripts may break. Most of the problems
arising from this can be fixed by replacing <tt>list_elim</tt> with
<tt>list_elim|</tt> and likewise for the others, so that the first
argument supplied is taken as the implicit parameter.
