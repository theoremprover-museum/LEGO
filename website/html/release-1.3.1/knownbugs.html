      <h1>LEGO Version 1.3.1: Known Bugs</h1>
      
      Please let us know if you come across any bugs in the current
      release. We are aware of the following problems:
      <dl>
	<!-- one of (dt dd) -->
      <dt>Double</dt>
        <dd>The computation of double elimination rules uses named variables.
        If an inductive definition uses a name twice or a name
        used by the system, the clash may cause an error. Workaround: do not
        duplicate names and never call anything "z".</dd>

      <dt>Expansion</dt>
	<dd>The command <tt>ExpAll</tt> no longer works.</dd>
	<dt>Freezing</dt>
	<dd>Freezing terms while constructing a proof may lead to
	problems in building the internal partial proof tree and LEGO
	  fails with <tt>*tocAppErr*</tt>.</dd>
	<dt>Pwd</dt>
	<dd>under Linux does not work.</dd>

      <dt>Reduction Rules</dt>
	<dd>Implicit arguments in constructors which cannot actually be
        inferred from
	later arguments may lead to illegal reduction rules, thus
	corrupting the object file.</dd>

      </dl>
