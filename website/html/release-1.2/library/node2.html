<P>
This report describes the current LEGO library, which was designed as
a basis upon which users can develop their own work, and also some
example proof developments using this library.
An earlier version of the library was developed
by Savi Maharaj for use by students being introduced
to the LEGO system<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#75"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/icons//foot_motif.gif"></A>. We hope that this version
will provide useful preliminaries for <EM>all</EM> users.
<P>
We have received contributions from: Thorsten Altenkirch; Petr Cizek;
Adriana Compagnoni; Healf Goguen; Martin Hofmann; Claire Jones; Savi
Maharaj; James McKinna; Randy Pollack; Thomas Schreiber.
<P>
The LEGO proof development tool is flexible -- users
can make various basic choices in how to use the
type system to encode their reasoning. We want
the library to support this flexibility.
Ideally, it should be possible for someone to use the library
with any reasonable encoding of e.g.  equality and logic,
and to choose where in the type hierarchy
the basic datatypes should be.  We believe that the current 
library achieves all of these goals with the exception that
we cater for only one encoding of logic.
<P>
The LEGO library contains around 250 definitions and 400 theorems,
and covers both the common datatypes such as natural numbers, list,
booleans, products, sums, unit, empty and some more unusual ones such
as integers, sigma types, quotient types, finite sets, vectors.
There is also a directory which contains 
some examples of proof developments
using the library.
<P>
The library exploits the new module
system of LEGO so that loading a library file will
automatically load the files on which it depends and 
two library files which depend on 
some common files will have the common files loaded
only once. So users don't need to know anything about the
dependency structure of the library, only where to find
the theorems they want. For faster loading, the library also stores 
``compiled'' versions of most files which can be accessed by using
the <code>Make</code> command in LEGO.
<P>
The library files are organised into directories by datatype.  Some
files rely on more than one datatype in which case they are put in
whatever directory seems most appropriate. 
The basic datatypes are given inductively with their elimination
and reduction rules. Library standards include deriving also
recursor, iterator, induction principle and 
the double elimination rule for each datatype and also the 
appropriate characterisation theorems
(e.g. disjointness of constructors).
<P>
In this document we will describe each file briefly and then
give a list of the definitions made and theorems proved
in each file.
