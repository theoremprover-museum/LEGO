<P>
At present the library supports three definitions of
(substitutive) equality: impredicative (Leibniz) equality
and two versions of inductive equality.
The library also allows the user to change the
universe in which datatypes are defined, and
the level over which their elimination rules
can range.
<P>
The user chooses an equality by simply loading
a library equality from those discussed below.
It is also possible for a user to create their
own equality file. Note that the equality
files also configure the LEGO command <TT>Qrepl</TT>.
<P>
The universe levels are controlled by setting
various LEGO variables before loading the
library files. There are currently four
variables: <TT>SET</TT>, <TT>TYPE</TT>, <TT>TYPE_minus1</TT>,
and <TT>TYPE_minus2</TT>.
<P>
All inductive datatypes are put in the type universe
given by the value of <TT>SET</TT>; furthermore
equality <TT>Eq</TT> is also defined over this 
type level. This variable can be set to 
any type universe level, including <TT>Prop</TT>.
<P>
All inductive datatypes have an elimination
rule which is quantified over some
expression of the form <TT>datatype -&gt; TYPE</TT>.
The value of <TT>TYPE</TT> can be chosen by the
user to be any universe level. However
we warn that many library file won't
work if <TT>TYPE</TT> is set to <TT>Prop</TT>.
See the final paragraph of this section for how to customize
the library to work with <TT>TYPE</TT> as <TT>Prop</TT>.
<P>
A small number of library files also use the type universe
variables <TT>TYPE_minus1</TT> and <TT>TYPE_minus2</TT>, which
should be set to universe levels strictly below <TT>TYPE</TT>.
As the names imply, <TT>TYPE_minus2</TT> should be set to a 
level strictly below <TT>TYPE_minus1</TT>.
<P>
The library files on finite sets and vectors require certain
restrictions to be imposed on the values assigned
to the type universe variables.  In both these files
<TT>TYPE_minus2</TT> must be at least <TT>Type(0)</TT>, 
and consequently <TT>TYPE_minus1</TT> must be at least <TT>Type(1)</TT>
and <TT>TYPE</TT> must be at least <TT>Type(2)</TT>.
<TT>Type_minus1</TT> is also used in the definition 
of inductive equality where its value can be any type universe
including <TT>Prop</TT>.
<P>
To exploit typical ambiguity [<A HREF="node92.html#harperpollackuniverses">Harper and Pollack, 1991</A>],
defintions<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#76"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/icons//foot_motif.gif"></A> need to be
expanded as <EM>macros</EM>. Unfortunately, this is not feasable. To
patch this problem, another subdirectory <TT>lib_Type</TT> has been
provided which contains variants of other modules where all parameters
have been replaced by <TT>Type</TT>. For convenience, these modules are
accessed in the default path.
<P>
For the user who wishes to work with <TT>TYPE</TT>
set to <TT>Prop</TT>, we give separate versions
of four of the library files which include
the single assumption <TT>true_not_false</TT> that
the two boolean values <TT>true</TT> and <TT>false</TT>
are not equal. These files can be loaded in
preference to the standard ones by adding
(the full pathname of) the top-level library directory
<TT>lib_prop</TT> before the root of the library
in the environment variable <TT>LEGOPATH</TT>.
For example, if the library is held in
<TT>$LEGOLIB</TT> then <TT>LEGOPATH</TT>
should be set to
<P>
<TT>$LEGOLIB/lib_prop:$LEGOLIB:$LEGOLIB/lib_all</TT>
<P>
(plus any other directories, of course; the current
working directory <TT>.</TT>&nbsp;being most usual).
With this set-up, all the library files except
vectors and finite sets will work.
<P>
